# When a new provider is registered, an appropriate discovery entry is added
# to the capabilities directory in order to make the new provider discoverable.
# If no expiry information is given during provider registration, this setting
# is used to determine a default expiry date. The expiry date will be
# 'now' + discovery-entry-expiry-interval-ms. After this date the capabilities
# directory might delete the discovery information and the provider is not
# discoverable anymore. # 86400000 = 1 day in millisecond.
